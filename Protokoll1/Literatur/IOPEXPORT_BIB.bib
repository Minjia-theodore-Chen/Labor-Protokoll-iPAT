	abstract = {In the present work two of the various drying process parameters, air temperature and nozzle speed, are studied and their influence on the electrode’s physical properties is examined by different mechanical and electrical analyzes. It was found that elasticity, electrical volume resistivity and adhesion strength of the coating to the substrate, can be dependent on process parameters used for manufacturing. These properties are also influenced by the electrode’s mass loading and its recipe, as the total solvent content and therefore the drying time plays an important role. Assuming binder demixing during drying allows explaining the results, since evaporating solvent induces a temperature dependent compensational flow of solvent and solved binder. If immobilization occurs faster than compensational flow can cause significant demixing, no binder gradient emerges. The driving force counteracts the drying time, but increases demixing, so that optimum drying conditions exist for each mass loading and solid content.}
